		<h3>Life Story</h3>
		<p>
			One day, she was born. Then, 8 years later, she was 8 years old. I know, riveting, but that's not all. When she was a child, she went to ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!!! You'll never guess what happened next though. SHE WENT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL NEXT! But, this leaves us with a single question. Where is she now? That is actually a pretty long story. You see, when people graduate frome middle school, they typically go to high school, and that's exactly what she did. Suprising, I know. Anyways, that's her entire life story up to this point.
		</p>
		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>
			There is a really popular &quot;game&quot; out these days called Roblox. People who play it like Madison insist that it's a fun &quot;game&quot;, but its actualy a horrible &quot;game.&quot; Now, I do admit that I am a little biased, but my opinion is still valid in this respect.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than playing Roblox, she sometimes makes some suprisingly good art. She's supprised me on a couple of occasions with it because she doesn't really seem like the artistic type. Then again, it's kind of hard to define a specific &quot;artistic type.&quot;

		<h2>Melissa</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Height: 5'2</li>

		<h3>Life Story</h3>
		<p>
			Around 14 years ago, Melissa saw for the first time, Melissa heard for the first time, Melissa tasted for the first time, and, Melissa cried for the first time; she was born. That is not all that her extravagent life entails though. Melissa, much like the modern youth, went throught elementary, middle, and she is now in high school. Along the way, she made many friends like her best friend, Madison, me, and Anthony. Now, she is striving for the future, and pranking her friends occasionally (I don't apreciate that).
		</p>
		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>
			Melissa, much like her best friend, enjoys the &quot;game&quot; Roblox. She tries to get her friends to play the &quot;game&quot; with her, but that would be absolute torture for Anthony and me. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than Roblox, Melissa is a pretty good writer. She's working on a book about a young boy with tourettes. I'm biased due to being her friend, but I think it has plenty of potential. My only pet peeve with her book is that she doesn't use enough commas. USE&nbsp;MORE&nbsp;COMMAS.
