		<h3>Life Story</h3>
		<p>
			One day, she was born. Then, 8 years later, she was 8 years old. I know, riveting, but that's not all. When she was a child, she went to ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!!! You'll never guess what happened next though. SHE WENT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL NEXT! But, this leaves us with a single question. Where is she now? That is actually a pretty long story. You see, when people graduate frome middle school, they typically go to high school, and that's exactly what she did. Suprising, I know. Anyways, that's her entire life story up to this point.

		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>
			There is a really popular &quot;game&quot; out these days called Roblox. People who play it like Madison insist that it's a fun &quot;game&quot;, but its actualy a horrible &quot;game.&quot; Now, I do admit that I am a little biased, but my opinion is still valid in this respect.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than playing Roblox, she sometimes makes some pretty good art. She's supprised me on a couple of occasions with it because she doesn't really seem like the artistic type. Then again, there its kind of hard to define a specific &quot;artistic type.&quot;
